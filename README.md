# InteractionMediaDesign
This repository contains the files from the project Museum Explorers one of the requisits for the course Digital Heritage Multimedia from the Master's degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna. 

To understand the project we suggest to beginning with the <a href= "https://github.com/Museum-Explorers/InteractionMediaDesign/blob/main/Museum%20Explorers%20Desing%20Brief.pdf">Design Brief</a>, then go to the <a href= "https://github.com/Museum-Explorers/InteractionMediaDesign/blob/main/Museum%20explorers.twee">Twine</a> and, in the end see the file with Screens.
