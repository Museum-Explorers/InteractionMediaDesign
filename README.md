This repository contains the files from the project Museum Explorers one of the requisits for the course Digital Heritage Multimedia from the Master's degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna. 

Museum Explorers is a gamification project in which the user engages in a quest for archeological treasures from the History of Bologna. It is based on some of the collections of the Bologna Civic Archaeological Museum (Museo Civico Archeologico di Bologna). Walking through the Prehistoric, Etruscan, Celtic, and Roman collections of the Museo Civico Archeologico of Bologna, the user finds some of the most interesting objects to understand the material culture that survived.

To understand the project we suggest to beginning with the <a href= "https://github.com/Museum-Explorers/InteractionMediaDesign/blob/main/Museum%20Explorers%20Desing%20Brief.pdf">Design Brief</a>, then go to the <a href= "https://github.com/Museum-Explorers/InteractionMediaDesign/blob/main/Museum%20explorers.twee">Twine</a> and, in the end see the file with Screens.
